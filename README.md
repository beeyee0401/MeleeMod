## Thanks and Acknowledgements
Thanks so much to FruityMod (https://github.com/gskleres/FruityMod-StS), this open-source project has helped me immensely in helping me understand how to implement everything. Some assets still remain from FruityMod in order for this mod to run, but eventually will be removed.

My friend Avi who has been helping me come up with ideas on how to improve the mechanics and testing the mod.

### Contribute
Any help is very appreciated on this, especially on the assets. New card ideas are welcome as well. Reach out to me via the email in my profile or in Discord (Bee#6942).
