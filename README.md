# MeleeMod
A Slay the Spire mod to add Super Smash Bros. Melee mechanics as cards and characters as playable classes

## Progress
Many cards for Captain Falcon are implemented and some of the main mechanics are created, but Powers and Relics still need work. The assets are not in the best state, as many FruityMod assets are still being used.

## Requirements
### General Use
* You can follow the steps found here to start Debugging and Building: https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/wiki/Getting-Started-(For-Modders)
* Java 8 (JRE). Currently only Java 8 should be used, issues with Java 9 are being looked into.
* BaseMod v.1.8.0+ (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases)
* ModTheSpire v2.3.0+ (https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases)

## Installation
1. Create a folder `lib` in the folder parent to this project
1. Copy `desktop-1.0.jar` from your Slay the Spire installation folder into the `lib` folder.
1. Download `BaseMod.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases) and save it in the `lib` folder.
1. The modded Slay The Spire can now be launched by double-clicking on `ModTheSpire.jar` or by starting it via Steam and choosing the Play with Mods option
1. Selecting `BaseMod` and `MeleeMod` are required in the mod check list

## Thanks and Acknowledgements
Thanks so much to FruityMod (https://github.com/gskleres/FruityMod-StS), this open-source project has helped me immensely in helping me understand how to implement everything. Some assets still remain from FruityMod in order for this mod to run, but eventually will be removed.

### Contribute
Any help is very appreciated on this, especially on the assets. New card ideas are welcome as well. Reach out to me via the email in my profile or in Discord (Bee#6942).
